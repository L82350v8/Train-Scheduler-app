# Train-Scheduler-app

This project was developed by a student learning how to incorporate the use of a firebase real time database into a web application. 

This application also uses JavaScript and jQuery programming languages. 

This project is very useful because the developer gained experience incorporating a real time database into a web application along with more JavaScript and jQuery experience. 


Here's how the application works:

Each user can schedule a train using the 'Add Train' form. 

To schedule a train, the user must provide the following information: 

    a. A Train name. 
    
    b. A train trip destination. 
    
    c. The train's first starting time expressed in a 24-hour time format. An example would be that 10 PM would be entered as 22:00 hours.  
    
    d. The train's route frequency expressed in minutes between each train trip. An example would be that a train runs a route every 30 minutes.    
    
When the user submits the new train schedule information, the application calculates the next train's arrival time and how many minutes away 

that is from the current time. The application also stores this information in the database thus, making the information available to other users.  

Currently, only the original developer maintains and contributes to this project.
